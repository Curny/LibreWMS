# LibreWMS
a free, open, multi-platform warehouse management program in C# / .Net

##IT IS IN AN EARLY DEVELOPMENT PHASE. 
Pre-Alpha. Most menu entries will not work at all. Input is not properly checked and may cause runtime errors!
At the moment I'll do it console based. Reason 1: it's quick. Reason 2: it works on Windows, Linux and MacOS without nasty adjustments :)

MySQL database access is realised with the *Dapper* Framework (https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper).

I want to create a warehouse management program. 
For start it will be console based to have no issues with the different operating systems, later I plan to add GUI for Mac, Win and Linux.


By the way, the data acess trial code is just commented out in Program.cs ... I tried to read from a local MySQL-Database and it worked. In the meantime I added some menu structure and will go on with the DB soon...


If you want to join in for development, don't hesitate. There's a lot of work to do ;)
