# LibreWMS
a free, open, multi-platform warehouse management program in C# / .Net

## IT IS IN AN EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE. 
Pre-Alpha. Most menu entries will not work at all. Input is not properly checked and may cause runtime errors! Expect weird code fragements, partly commented out, everywhere :)))

Database: for now only MySQL/MariadDB. Access is realised with the *Dapper* Framework (https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper).

For now it will be console based. Reason 1: it's quick. Reason 2: it works on Windows, Linux and MacOS without nasty adjustments :) ... later I plan to add GUI for Mac, Win and Linux.

If you want to join in for development, don't hesitate. There's a lot of work to do ;)
