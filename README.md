# LibreWMS
a free, open, multi-platform warehouse management program in C# / .Net

MySQL database access is realised with the *Dapper* Framework (https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper).

I want to create a warehouse management program. 
For start it will be console based to have no issues with the different operating systems, later I plan to add GUI for Mac, Win and Linux.
