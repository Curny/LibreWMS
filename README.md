# LibreWMS
a free, open, multi-platform warehouse management program in C# / .Net

## IT IS IN AN EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE. 
Alpha-Version.
Expect weird errors ;)

Database: for now only MySQL/MariadDB. Access is realised with the *Dapper* Framework (https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper).

For now it will be console based. 
Reason 1: it's quick. 
Reason 2: it works on Windows, Linux and MacOS without nasty adjustments :) ... 
later I plan to implement it web-based with Blazor.

If you want to join in for development, don't hesitate. There's a lot of work to do ;)
